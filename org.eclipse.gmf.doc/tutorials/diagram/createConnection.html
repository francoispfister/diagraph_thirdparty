<p>In this tutorial, we will use the Logic Diagram Example to
illustrate how to add a connection edge to a diagram. We will use
the wire connection as the example. To gain familiarity with the
Logic Diagram Example, refer to the <a
href="../../examples-guide/diagram/logicExample.html">Logic Example
Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Most diagrams have a need to display semantic relationships that
exist between elements.&nbsp; In the Logic example, this is also
the case.&nbsp; There is an element called ?Wire? which allows
logic elements to be connected to each other.&nbsp; It is literally
the wire that carries electricity between terminals on circuits and
LED elements in the circuit board.&nbsp; The mechanism for adding a
connection shape on a diagram is very similar to how a shape is
added except for some subtle difference in API.&nbsp; This is
summarized below.</p>

<h3><a id="_Toc104273250" name="_Toc104273250">Example: LED
connected by wires</a><br />
 <img width="104" height="218" src="connectedLED.gif" /></h3>

<h3><a id="_Toc104273251" name="_Toc104273251">Adding a Wire
palette entry to the contribution for the palette provider</a></h3>

<p>See section <a href="createShape.html#palette">#Add entries to
the contribution for the palette provider.</a></p>

<h3><a id="_Toc104273252" name="_Toc104273252">Adding a new Wire
creation tool instrumented from a palette factory class</a></h3>

<p>A new condition needs to be added in the LogicPaletteFactory
class in the createTool method.&nbsp; For a connection a
ConnectionCreationTool instance is created passing in an
IElementType hint (wire) that will be sent in a request to return a
command for creating the connection.</p>

<h3><a id="_Toc104273253" name="_Toc104273253">Add new View
provider entry</a></h3>

<p>In order to respond to the tool request we need to create a
provider for creating the notation (View) for the new shape.&nbsp;
First it is necessary to add plug-in.xml extension for the
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.diagram.core.viewProviders extension
point.&nbsp; We indicate the viewClass context
(org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.notation.Edge) and provide a hint for our
provider to be invoked upon (wire).&nbsp; Similar to <a
href="createShape.html#notation">#Add new Vie</a><a
href="createShape.html#notation"></a><a
href="createShape.html#notation">w provider entry</a> a mapping of
the hint to the view class that will construct the connection
notation is necessary in the getConnectionViewClass method.&nbsp;
The WireView.java class will serve this purpose.&nbsp; The WireView
class subclasses from AbstractConnectionView.&nbsp; Please refer to
the WireView class for details of what initialization is
needed.</p>

<h3><a id="_Toc104273254" name="_Toc104273254">Add new Editpart
provider entry</a></h3>

<p>Refer to <a href="createShape.html#editpart">#Add new Editpart
provider entry</a> on how to add a plugin.xml entry for a
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.diagram.ui.editpartProviders extension. In
the LogicEditPartProvider class there is simply a mapping from the
View class to the EditPart class that needs to be created in the
getConnectionEditPartClass method.&nbsp; The WireEditPart class
contains code for managing creating the IFigure
(PolylineConnectionEx ) class and responding to property change
events.</p>

<h2><a id="betweenShapes" name="betweenShapes">Drawing connections
between shapes</a></h2>

[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]

<p>The notation meta-model stores all layout constraint units
(positions, bendpoints and anchors) in HiMetric units (0.1
millimeter).&nbsp; This allows for a high level of precision when
dealing with zoomed in diagrams.&nbsp; This adds some complexity to
the figure display since GEF assumes pixel units when drawing
figures onto the canvas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case where we wish to connect 2 LED shapes via a wire
connection, we'll need to do some conversion of the pixel values to
HiMetric before the connection can accurately connect to the
LEDFigure.&nbsp; The function MapMode.DPtoLP(int deviceUnit) is
used to convert a Device Unit (pixels) into a Logical Unit.&nbsp;
This method needs to be instrumented in the LEDFigure when drawing
the connection nubs around the shape.&nbsp; Additionally by
abstracting the pixels through this MapMode, it will allow the
platform to support a different coordinate systems in the future
without affecting clients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A somewhat unique aspect of the Logic example is that the wires
don't connect directly to the top level shapes.&nbsp; They always
connect via terminal elements that exist on the borders of the
shapes.&nbsp; If we consider the LED shape, it has 8 terminals
surrounding it where 4 are incoming terminals and 4 are outgoing
terminals.&nbsp; To accomplish this, it is necessary to have a
separate view represent the terminal on the border of the LED
view.&nbsp; The terminal views on the LED are essential to the
functionality of the LED so they need to be represented all the
time.&nbsp; This is referred to as a canonical
representation.&nbsp; The means that the children of a particular
view are always fully synchronized with the corresponding semantic
element children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a facility in the diagram layer that can manage this
synchronization called the CanonicalEditPolicy.&nbsp; This
EditPolicy is installed on an EditPart and is responsible for
managing the creation of child views that need to be created if a
semantic child exists.&nbsp; The LEDEditPart has a subclass of this
EditPolicy called LogicCanonicalEditPolicy that discovers the
terminal children of the LED semantic element and creates
corresponding terminal views for each terminal element.</p>

<h2><a id="fixedAnchors" name="fixedAnchors">Connecting the wires
at fixed anchors</a></h2>

[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]

<p>The default behavior when connecting to a shape allows the end
of the connection to be anywhere around the source or target
shape.&nbsp; In the case of the wire connection, we want it to
connect at a very specific location on the terminal and don't need
to have the flexibility of moving it around the shape.&nbsp; The
anchoring behavior is handled in the IFigure hierarchy through the
ConnectionAnchor interface.</p>

<p>To change the default behavior, we need to override some methods
in the IFigure implementation to return a different anchor.&nbsp;
In the LEDFigure class the getSourceConnectionAnchorAt and
getTargetConnectionAnchorAt functions need to be overridden in
LEDFigure and return a anchor that will return a fixed point with
the figure bounds.</p>

<p>In LEDFigure:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* @see
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.gef.ui.figures.NodeFigure#getSourceConnectionAnchorAt(org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Point)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public ConnectionAnchor
getSourceConnectionAnchorAt(Point p) {</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (p == null) {</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
return getConnectionAnchor(szAnchor);</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
return fixedAnchor;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>

<p>public Vector getSourceConnectionAnchors() {</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return
outputConnectionAnchors;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Support for reconnection between two shapes at fixed
anchors</h3>

<p>When creating or reconnecting a wire between terminals on the
logical example, this is not only</p>

<p>changing the notation by moving the end points, it is also
changing the underlying semantic model that the diagram is
representing.&nbsp; This behavior is centralized with-in the
EditHelper for wire metaModelType.&nbsp; The WireEditHelper
overrides the AbstractEditHelper#getReorientRelationshipCommand to
return the command that handles reorient of the logic wire
element.&nbsp; For instance, when a palette tool is invoked, it is
sending a request that is handled by the SemanticEditPolicy which
in terms handles the creation.&nbsp; Similarly when the user
reorients the end of a wire in the logic example, a request is sent
automatically by the infrastructure to the SemanticEditPolicy which
determines if there is a metaModelType registered that can handle
the request.&nbsp; In this case the wire metaModelType would be
found and would return the WireEditHelper which can provide a
command for this request that subsequently gets executed making the
changes against the logic semantic model.</p>

<p>In WireEditHelper.java:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* Gets a command to
change the source or target of a wire.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected
IEditElementCommand getReorientRelationshipCommand(</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ReorientRelationshipRequest req) {</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
return new ReorientWireCommand(req);</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
